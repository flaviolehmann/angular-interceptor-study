# Angular API Mocker
Built for study purpose over angular interceptors. Using a Spring App (Java) as backend.

### How do I run it?
1. The backend is a mvn project, you can install the dependecies from your favorite IDE and run it from there.
2. The frontend is a node project, you'll need to run a 'npm install' and then you can run it using 'npm start' (or 'ng serve' if you have angular cli)

### Can you show me an image of it working?
Here it is!

### I want to help!
Well, you could start helping me with the styling. Maybe some Material design would give it another feeling.
